Next Steps for Tomorrow:

1. Install Git and ensure it's available in your PATH to enable pushing to GitHub.
2. Start the backend application locally so tests can connect and run successfully.
3. Re-run the login tests to confirm they pass with the updated endpoint and payload.
4. Push the project to your GitHub repository once Git is working.
5. Continue development and testing as needed.

Let's go hard in the paint tomorrow!
